Quest Viva's **WebPlayer** lets you serve any Quest game to a web browser. The game code itself runs on the server, with the web browser sending the player's input and receiving the game's output.

There are two ways of running WebPlayer:
- run using Docker
- build from the Quest Viva source code

## Run WebPlayer using Docker

First, install and run [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). For configuration, you can create a `compose.yaml` file:

```yaml
services:
  webplayer:
    image: ghcr.io/textadventures/quest-viva-webplayer:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      dev__Enabled: true
```

You can then run this using:

```bash
docker compose up
```

WebPlayer will now be running at <text>http://localhost:8080</text>

The configuration above sets the `dev__Enabled` environment variable to `true`, which enables the developer mode. This enables uploading a game directly into the container, which is handy for testing - though you probably don't want to enable this on a production server.

While Quest Viva is under active development, you may want to pass the `--pull always` flag so that Docker always fetches the latest version, instead of using a cached one:

```bash
docker compose up --pull always
```

## Build from source

As an alternative to Docker, you can build and run directly on your machine.

First, you will need to download and install the [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).

Next, use `git` to clone the Quest Viva source code from <text>https://github.com/textadventures/quest</text>

Then you can run using:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/WebPlayer/WebPlayer.csproj
```

You should then have WebPlayer running, by default at <text>http://localhost:5052</text>

## Configuration

### Home page

You can choose a game to serve on the home page.

  <TabItem label="Docker">
    You need to specify a `Home__File` environment variable to point to the game, _and_ that game needs to be available in the Docker environment. To do that, you need to set up a Docker volume.

    Here's an example that serves `/path/to/your-game.quest` on your machine via a Docker volume, which exposes it as `data/your-game.quest` in the container:

    ```yaml
    services:
      webplayer:
        image: ghcr.io/textadventures/quest-viva-webplayer:latest
        ports:
          - "8080:8080"
        environment:
          Home__File: "/data/your-game.quest"
        volumes:
          - "/path/to/your-game.quest:/data/your-game.quest:ro"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Source">
    Update `appsettings.json`, like this:

    ```json
    {
      "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
          "Default": "Information",
          "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
        }
      },
      "AllowedHosts": "*",
      "Home": {
        "File": "/path/to/your-game.quest"
      }
    }

    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Debugger

If you're developing your game, then you may want to enable the debugger.

<Tabs syncKey='config'>
  Set the `Home__Debug` environment variable to `true` to enable the debugger.

  <TabItem label="Docker">
    ```yaml
    services:
      webplayer:
        image: ghcr.io/textadventures/quest-viva-webplayer:latest
        ports:
          - "8080:8080"
        environment:
          Home__File: "/data/your-game.quest"
          Home__Debug: true
        volumes:
          - "/path/to/your-game.quest:/data/your-game.quest:ro"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Source">
    Update `appsettings.json`, like this:

    ```json
    {
      "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
          "Default": "Information",
          "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
        }
      },
      "AllowedHosts": "*",
      "Home": {
        "File": "/path/to/your-game.quest"
        "Debug": true
      }
    }

    ```
  </TabItem>

  When running the game, you'll see a "Debug" button in the top right corner. Click this to open the debugger.
</Tabs>

### Developer mode

Enable developer mode to allow uploading a game directly into the container. This is useful for testing, as you don't need to restart your container to recreate your volume. You probably don't want to enable this on a production server though. In this mode, if there is no home page game specified, it will link to the file upload page. Otherwise you can access the page at `/dev/open`.

<Tabs syncKey='config'>
  <TabItem label="Docker">
    You need to set the `Dev__Enabled` environment variable to `true`:
    
    ```yaml
    services:
      webplayer:
        image: ghcr.io/textadventures/quest-viva-webplayer:latest
        ports:
          - "8080:8080"
        environment:
          Dev__Enabled: true
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Source">
    Update `appsettings.json`, like this:

    ```json
    {
      "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
          "Default": "Information",
          "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
        }
      },
      "AllowedHosts": "*",
      "Dev": {
        "Enabled": true
      }
    }

    ```
  </TabItem>

  The debugger is always enabled in developer mode. When running the game, you'll see a "Debug" button in the top right corner. Click this to open the debugger.
