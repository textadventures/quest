## What is Quest Viva?

Quest Viva is the "next version" of [Quest 5](https://textadventures.co.uk/quest).

Quest 5 has been around since 2011, and has a number of limitations. It's written in .NET Framework 4, meaning it only runs offline on Windows. For online play in a web browser, it requires a Windows Server to be running. The game playing and editing experiences can differ between desktop and browser versions. Online players sometimes find the game runs slowly, and they can be kicked out of their session if there are network issues.

Quest Viva is intended to address all of these limitations. It runs using the latest cross-platform version of .NET, meaning games can run offline on Windows, Mac and Linux. It uses ASP.NET Blazor which can compile to WASM, meaning online players will be able to download all the code needed to run a game directly into their browser - no dependency on a server connection. This means games will run faster, any number of players can play at the same time, and the game will continue to run even if the network connection is lost.

## Why not call it Quest 6?

Because there's [another system](https://github.com/ThePix/QuestJS) already called that (although that is more commonly referred to as QuestJS).

## Sounds great, how do I get started?

It's a work in progress - that means it's not ready to be used quite yet.

For now, if you want to create a game, please use [Quest 5](https://textadventures.co.uk/quest).

If you want to host a game on your own server, Quest Viva's [WebPlayer](webplayer) is currently in alpha testing.
