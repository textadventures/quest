  <Card title="Cross-platform" icon="forward-slash">
		Quest Viva is built with .NET 9, so it runs on Windows, Mac and Linux.
	</Card>
  <Card title="Host your own games" icon="document">
		It's now much easier to host your own games on any Linux VPS using a Docker image. Soon, you'll be able to run games entirely in the browser using
    WebAssembly, with no need to run a server at all.
	</Card>
  <Card title="Save games without logging in" icon="cloud-download">
		Players no longer need to create an account to save their progress. Game data is saved to the browser's local storage.
	</Card>
  <Card title="Responsive layout" icon="laptop">
		All devices are now handled using a responsive layout, so the game will look good on any screen size.
	</Card>
  <Card title="Debugger" icon="pen">
		Quest Viva brings the game debugger to the browser for the first time. Inspect objects and run walkthroughs.
	</Card>
	{/* <Card title="It's free..." icon="sun">

    You don't need to ask for permission - you already have it.

	<Card title="Get started quickly" icon="rocket">
		You don't need to know how to program to use Quest Viva. But you might pick up some handy programming knowledge along the way.

    Everything about your game is displayed in plain English, but the source code to your game is also viewable and editable for the more technically minded.

    A full tutorial is included, and help is always available on [Discord](https://textadventures.co.uk/community/discord) and [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/textadventures/quest/discussions).

	<Card title="Ever wanted to..." icon="approve-check">

  <Card title="Surprisingly powerful" icon="seti:html">
    Quest Viva is a powerful game platform. Although designed to be easy to learn, it has huge power when you need it.

    There is a fully featured scripting language behind the scenes, which you can dip in and out of as required. You can use variables and functions, and encapsulate functionality using object types to share scripts between objects. You can create and share libraries of advanced functionality.
	</Card>
  <Card title="Graphics, sound and video" icon="seti:video">
		Who says text adventures are all about text?

    You can add pictures to your game, music and sound effects. You can even embed video from YouTube.

    And you can go even further, by customising the user interface using HTML and Javascript, to get your game looking exactly how you want it.
	</Card>
  <Card title="Any language" icon="translate">
		Create games in English, French, German, Spanish, Dutch, Italian, Poruguese, Romanian, even Esperanto.

    Or create your own translation.

    Publish your game to [textadventures.co.uk](https://textadventures.co.uk/), the top destination for people looking for text adventure games to play. Or, host your game on your own server.

    There's no need for players to download any software - people can play your game directly in their browser, whatever device they're using.
