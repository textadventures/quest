    ToWords (int)

**New in Quest 5.7**    

Returns a [string](../../types/string.html) - the given integer in word form (i.e., one, two...). Numbers outside the range -1999 to 1999 are returned as the digits, but in a string (eg "2000").

This function is part of English.aslx, and is currently only available in English. We would welcome any code for other languages, to be added to later versions of Quest.
