    Grid_LoadSvg (string data, string id)

Loads a SVG file and associates it with an id, so it can subsequently be drawn on the custom grid drawing layer using [Grid\_DrawSvg](grid_drawsvg.html).

The data parameter is the raw file data for the SVG file - you can load a string with file data using the [GetFileData](../../functions/getfiledata.html) function.
