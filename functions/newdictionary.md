    NewDictionary ()

Returns an empty [dictionary](../using_dictionaries.html). The dictionary can contain any type of data, or a mixture - for example, both objects and strings.

If the dictionary will only contain one type of data (as will usually be the case), you should use [NewStringDictionary](newstringdictionary.html) or [NewObjectDictionary](newobjectdictionary.html) instead.
