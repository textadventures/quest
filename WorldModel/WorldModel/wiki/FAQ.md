Note: _This is a work in progress..._


## Session has ended

When playing games on the TextAdventures web site, you may see a message that your session has ended. This happens if the server has not heard from you for a while. It is a necessary function of the server, as people on the web site do not tell us when they are leaving the site, they just go! If sessions did not time out, the server would be remembering millions of sessions.

So this is a necessary evil, and the best you can do is warn players, and advise them to either log in so they can save their progress or to download your game and use the off-line version.


## Hosting games

It is possible to host Quest games yourself, but not easy, to say the least (and I do not know the details). You will need to download the web player from Github, and upload it to your own site (and servers will almost certainly charge you for the privilege).

An alternative is to link to TextAdventures from your web page. You can either link to the web page on TextAdventurers, which would allow users to comment, review and reload saved game; or you can link to the game itself, which would appear to be running on your web site.

If you just want to host the game file, to be downloaded and played off-line, this is simply a case of uploading the .quest file to your site, and providing a link to it.


## Multiplayer

It is possible to create multiplayer games. You will need to find your own server to run `Node.js`, and some experience of networking is required.

Note that this is not well supported, and I am not aware of anyone actually using it. You are pretty much on your own here!


## Making money from your game

Firstly, do not expect to get rich, whatever you do.

I have no experience of this, but a starting point is [this thread](http://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/0pxjjixixkkta8hlbh4c2a/can-i-make-money-for-my-work).
