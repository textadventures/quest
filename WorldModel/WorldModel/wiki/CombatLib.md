On [this page](https://github.com/ThePix/quest/wiki/RPG-Part-02:-Game-Design) I discussed some of the design considerations for making an RPG-style game. One approach is to use CombatLib, a library of types and functions where most of the hard work is done for you. Even a ready-built library is not trivial as there is a lot in it, and this series of pages will walk you through the process.

This is the library used in my own game, [Deeper](http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/em15b32xd0o-y-ysvgrtcg/deeper); take a look if you want to see how combat will play out.

### Demo Game

[Demo](https://github.com/ThePix/quest/blob/master/combat_test.aslx)

You will need all the library files as described in [Part 1](https://github.com/ThePix/quest/wiki/CombatLib-Part-01:-Introduction). This includes 20 spells, over 40 weapons and over 100 monsters that you can look at and copy directly into your game. It also has a simple dialogue panel allowing the player to spend points on attributes.

You could even use this as the start of your game - but give it a new Game ID on the _Setup_ tab of the game object (and name and author too!).

### Other Useful Libraries

If you are building a large RPG-style game, you might also want to look at these libraries:


[Conversation Library](https://github.com/ThePix/quest/wiki/Conversations:-Library): Build dynamic conversations for your NPCs. 

[Quest Library](https://github.com/ThePix/quest/wiki/Quest-Library): A way to track quests in Quest.

[Second Inventory Pane](https://github.com/ThePix/quest/wiki/Second-Inventory-Library): Add a second inventory pane to your game (especially useful for spells).

[Shop Library](https://github.com/ThePix/quest/wiki/Shop-Library): Allow the player to buy and sell goods.

[Stack Library](https://github.com/ThePix/quest/wiki/StackLib): Have items stack in the player's inventory pane.
