This is a brief look at the more well known systems. Clearly I have a vested interested in Quest, so cannot claim to be unbiased.

Text Adventures
----------------

### Adrift

http://www.adrift.co/

Adrift seems to have several parallels to Quest. Like Quest, the author fills in fields in GUI for a room or item, making it very easy for new-comers.

### Alan

https://www.alanif.se/

The game is written as a text file, in words but code styled.
The web site says version 2 is "very obsolete", but version 3 is still in beta and has been for over 2 years, so it is not clear if this is still supported.

### TADS 3

http://www.tads.org/tads3.htm

The game is written as a text file, in C-like code, which is then compiled to make the game. This makes it rather complicated to learn, write and understand. This is recognised as the most technically advanced language, and has a wide range of libraries to support it. At one time the most popular, its complexity has led to a decline and I get the impression few people still use it, however, it is still in use..

### Inform 6

http://inform-fiction.org/Welcome.html

The game is written as a text file, in somewhat archaic, which is compiled into code designed to run on the Z-machine, like Infocom games back in the eighties (though in an updated form). Inform 6 came out over twenty years ago, and I do not think is used to write game any more, but is still used for libraries for Inform 7.


### Inform 7

http://inform7.com/

Inform 7 games are compiled to Inform 6, which is then complied to Z-code (or similar). As mentioned, libraries must be written in Inform 6, which is very different, though there are plenty of libraries available.
The game is written as a text file, in words resembling natural language (but with very exact rules about how it is written, just like every other system). While all the other systems listed here are object-orientated, Inform 7 is rules orientated.
Inform 7 is the most popular system with "serious" authors, as evidenced by the text adventures in IfComp each year (out of 21 text adventures written on known systems in the 2016 competition, 16 were in Inform 7, with just two in Quest and Inform 6, and one in TADS).

### Hugo

http://www.generalcoffee.com/hugo/gethugo.html

The game is written as a text file, in words but code styled
The manual is copyright 2004, and the most recent version of Windows mentioned is WinXP, so I think it is safe to say this is no longer supported.

Multi-choice Games
------------------

There are a lot of options appears in this category recently. 

### Twine

https://twinery.org/

Far and away the most popular system is Twine. It is easy to use, with a graphical display like a flow chart that makes clear the structure of the story. I think it is the original.

### Squiffy

http://textadventures.co.uk/squiffy

From the same stable as Quest.

### Quest Gamebook

http://textadventures.co.uk/quest

Despite my interests in Quest, I would not recommend the Gamebook mode of Quest!

### ChoiceScript

https://www.choiceofgames.com/make-your-own-games/choicescript-intro/

ChoiceScript is the system for Choice of Games, a commercial enterprise that will actually pay you for games written using their system (if of a certain standard!).
