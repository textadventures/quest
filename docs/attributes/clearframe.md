title: clearframe

"clearframe" is a [boolean](../types/boolean.html) attribute, which is only relevant if [useframe](useframe.html) is turned on. If clearframe is set to true, if a room does not define a [picture attribute](picture_attribute.html), the static picture frame is cleared for that room. If clearframe is set to false, the previous room's image would remain on the screen.
