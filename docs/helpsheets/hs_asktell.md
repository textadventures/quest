title: Ask and Tell
---

*You can use Ask and Tell commands to interact with other objects in the game eg if you go into a room with a wizard, you could ask him questions and have answers programmed to come out?*

*The **Ask** command works as part of a sequence - “**Ask Object about…**”* *The **Tell** command works as part of a sequence- “**Tell Object about…**”*

1. I have set up a room with a character called '''The Wizard '' inside it

5. Now enter some key words that are linked to what you want to ask the Wizard – remember it needs to be in a question – **Ask Wizard about…**

6. For example, say I want to ask the wizard about the game, I could use key words like game, adventure, puzzle or story.

7. I enter these in the box separated by spaces:

11. You can add as many Keys and scripts as you want.

12. When it works it looks like this. I write in the message **Ask wizard about game**

13. The wizard replies:

**IMPROVEMENTS** You can make the wizard human by selecting Wizard and Setup and choosing **Male Character**

When you do this, the wizard has the verb **Speak to** in the Display menu:

You can add in a command in **Verbs** to remind the player to ask the Wizard a clue eg   I go to Verb and type in “speak to”:

I click **OK** and underneath I write a suitable message:

This is now what it looks like when you select **speak to** in the game:

**YOU CAN DO THE EXACT SAME THING WITH THE TELL COMMAND**

Here is an example of a character where you can them lots of different **Ask** questions!
