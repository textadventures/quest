    NewList ()

**New in Quest 5.4**

Returns an empty [list](../types/list.html). The list can contain any type of data, or a mixture - for example, both objects and strings.

If the list will only contain one type of data (as will usually be the case), you should use [NewStringList](newstringlist.html) or [NewObjectList](newobjectlist.html) instead.

NOTE: This function is hard-coded and cannot be overridden.
