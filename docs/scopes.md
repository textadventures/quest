Core.aslx defines various "scope" functions. Each of these will return an object list (possible empty). Scope functions that end "ForRoom" must be given a room as a parameter (other functions will default to the current room).


Exits
-----

* [ScopeExits](functions/corelibrary/scopeexits.html)
Exits that the player can use from the current location, i.e., all visible exits for this room, whether locked or not.
* [ScopeExitsForRoom](functions/corelibrary/scopeexitsforroom.html)
* [ScopeUnlockedExitsForRoom](functions/corelibrary/scopeunlockedexitsforroom.html)
From Quest 5.7.


Commands
--------

* [ScopeCommands](functions/corelibrary/scopecommands.html) Gets a list of all global commands and all the lists for the current room.


Reachable Objects
-----------------

Quest makes a distinction between objects a player can reach and objects the player can see. Obviously with most objects, the player can do both, but this can be important in some situations.

Objects in a container are considered _reachable_ if the container is open. If an item's `visible` attribute is not set (i.e., it is `false`), or if the room is dark and the object is not a light source, then the object is not _reachable_.


* [ScopeReachableInventory](functions/corelibrary/scopereachableinventory.html) Items carried that are also _reachable_.
* [ScopeReachable](functions/corelibrary/scopereachable.html)
All objects in this scope can be interacted with directly by the player, items in the current room or in the inventory that are _reachable_.
* [ScopeReachableForRoom](functions/corelibrary/scopereachableforroom.html)
All objects in the room that are _reachable_ by the player. If this is the current room, then it will include items in the inventory that are _reachable_.
* [ScopeReachableNotHeld](functions/corelibrary/scopereachablenotheld.html) These objects are in the current room and can be interacted with, but they're not in the player's inventory.
* [ScopeReachableNotHeldForRoom](functions/corelibrary/scopereachablenotheldforroom.html)

Visible Objects
---------------

Objects in a container are considered _visible_ if it is either open or transparent (or both). If an item's `visible` attribute is not set (i.e., it is `false`), or if the room is dark and the object is not a light source, then the object is not _visible_.

* [ScopeInventory](functions/corelibrary/scopeinventory.html) All the _visible_ objects the player is carrying. Used to populate the "Inventory" list, and the list of objects returned by the "inventory" command.
* [ScopeVisible](functions/corelibrary/scopevisible.html)
Any carried items and items in the room that are _visible_.
* [ScopeVisibleForRoom](functions/corelibrary/scopevisibleforroom.html)
All objects in the room that are _visible_ by the player. If this is the current room, then it will include items in the inventory that are _visible_.
* [ScopeVisibleNotHeld](functions/corelibrary/scopevisiblenotheld.html)
This is everything _visible_ in the current room.
* [ScopeVisibleNotHeldForRoom](functions/corelibrary/scopevisiblenotheldforroom.html)
* [ScopeVisibleNotHeldNotScenery](functions/corelibrary/scopevisiblenotheldnotscenery.html) As `ScopeVisibleNotHeld`, but excludes items tagged as scenery.
* [ScopeVisibleNotHeldNotSceneryForRoom](functions/corelibrary/scopevisiblenotheldnotsceneryforroom.html)
* [ScopeVisibleNotReachable](functions/corelibrary/scopevisiblenotreachable.html)
All objects in this scope are _visible_ but not _reachable_.
* [ScopeVisibleNotReachableForRoom](functions/corelibrary/scopevisiblenotreachableforroom.html)
