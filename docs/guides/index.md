This page is for "how to" guides which don't fit in to the tutorial.


General Advice
--------------

-   [Competition Entry](competition_entry.html) (advice on submitting your game for a competition)



Simple
------

Easy to implement using only the GUI.

-   [Implementing a starting inventory](starting_inventory.html)

-   [Organising rooms](organise_rooms.html)
-   [Add scenery to groups of rooms](scenery.html)
-   [Time-limited puzzles](timelimitedpuzzles.html)
-   [Security code to unlock door](unlockdoor.html)
-   [Hidden/Invisible exit](hiddenexit.html)
-   [Implementing components of an object](implementing_components_of_an_object.html)


Basic
-----

Be prepared to see code - but not write it. Most of these have blocks of code, but do not let that put you off; it is pretty easy to copy-and-paste a chunk of code straight into your game, then go back to the GUI view to look at it or change it, as the first link in this section explains.
