title: How to
---

This page is for "how to" guides which don't fit in to the tutorial (and may be out of date).




Simple
------

Easy to implement using only the GUI.

-   [Time-limited puzzles](timelimitedpuzzles.html)
-   [Security code to unlock door](unlockdoor.html)
-   [Starting inventory](starting_inventory.html)


Basic
-----

Be prepared to see code - but not write it. Most of these have blocks of code, but do not let that put you off; it is pretty easy to copy-and-paste a chunk of code straight into your game, then go back to the GUI view to look at it or change it.
