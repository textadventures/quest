    ListExclude (list, any type item or list)

Returns a copy of the [stringlist](../types/stringlist.html) or [objectlist](../types/objectlist.html), with the specified item removed, or with all the items removed if the second parameter is a list.

Note that this is different to the [list remove](../scripts/list_remove.html) script command, as that removes the item from the original list. ListExclude by contrast returns a copy of the list - the original list is unaffected.

This function was added in Quest 5.1.

NOTE: This function is hard-coded and cannot be overridden.
