title: Quest 5.8
---

This file documents changes to Quest as of version 5.7.

Preamble
--------

This is my second major release for Quest, and in fact most of it has been done by other people.

Thanks to the beta-testers: Darryl Huen, KV (so far!).


New Interface
-------------
The big change in this version is the new interface. This is all thanks to SoonGames. Take a look! We hope you like it.


Internationalisation
--------------------

All the work on getting Quest better set up for internationalisation was also done by SoonGames. Thanks also to everyone who contributed translations:

- Danish: Benny Askham
- German: SoonGames
- Greek: Thanasis Chrysos
- Italian: Skarnisk
- Spanish: Luis


Other changes
-------------

Quest will not allow bad attribute names in the editor ("object", "turnscript", etc.). Previously these could break your game. You can still use these in a script, which is still a problem.

Can now check if played on webplayer, desktop or mobile

A new command, TELL <char> TO <text> or <char>, <text> has been added to the _Ask/Tell_ tab.

Turnscripts have been revised a little. There is a new function, SuppressTurnscripts, which will stop all turnscipts for one turn. You might want to do this for a HELP command, for example, or for events caught by the map. The UNDO command now does this automatically, so turnscripts make more sense in that context. Also, turnscripts now run in alphabetical order (previously the order of global and local scripts would be reversed in a loaded game; now the order is always the same).

The `QuickParam` function will create a dictionary with one entry that you can pass to a script as a parameter.

Scope for a command can now be set to an object list attribute of the player object.

Cloning an object also clones its child objects. Now they get the correct "alias" and "prototype" attributes set.

Following a [suggestion from mrangel](http://textadventures.co.uk/forum/quest/topic/ij3dghpuok_kgo3myoj4vg/thinking-about-the-text-processor), text processor directives are now extensible.


### Thanks to KV:

RESTART command

Advanced popups

LOOK AT now counts how many times an object has been looked at

TAKE ALL will ignore any object with "not_all" set to true

Transcripts and logging now possible

Improved VERSION command

You can now check the "isroom" attribute to see if an object is a room, and use `AllRooms` to get a list of rooms in the game.

New functions `DictionaryAdd` and `DictionaryRemove`, the first will overwrite an existing entry if it exists, rather than throw an error, the latter will do nothing if it does not exist.

### Thanks to Pertex:
Games can now send data to external sites, for processing, eg by PHP. This means you could set up a site that saves high scores, or records the number of people who chose a certain path through your game.

Thanks to SoonGames:
DeveloperMode (see [here](https://textadventures.co.uk/forum/samples/topic/k8lt6jukx0ko-dxms8vctg/sg-developer-mode-development-tool-for-better-testing-the-running-game).
