Quest 5 is free, [open source](open_source.html) software for creating text adventure games. It is designed to be powerful, extensible and easy to learn. You can create games in any language - Quest currently has templates for English, French, German, Spanish, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Esperanto, Russian and Icelandic.

You can [use Quest in your web browser](http://textadventures.co.uk/create), or [download a version for Windows](http://textadventures.co.uk/quest/desktop) (or start with the web, and if you like it, download the game you are working on, and finish it on the desktop version).
