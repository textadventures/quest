As of Quest 5.8 there is a fully functional transcript feature. A transcript is a recording of everything the game prints, and can be very useful when beta-testing, for example.

The transcript is automatically stored in the game's HTML code by Quest.

You can view the transcript at any time during play, using one of these comnmands. The transcript will appear in a pop-up window. You can print the transcript too.

CSS is added to set the background to white. Be aware that the transcript may have a few strange-looking areas, depending on what all HTML and CSS code you have in a game (we are fixing every issue we come across, but it is hard to foresee what code a Quest game may include!).

Note that during play you can type a * and then some text, and Quest will ignore it. This is useful for when you want to comment on something, such as a bug you have found. The comment will appear in the transcript (and can be searched for as it starts with a *), but you will not confuse the game with your weird command.
