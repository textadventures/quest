    foreach (iterator variable, list) { script }

Run a script for each item in a list. If the list is a dictionary, the loop iterates over the dictionary keys.

_Note:_ Do not use an attribute as the iterator variable (see [here](for.html)).

For more on how and why to use `foreach`, see [Using Lists](../guides/using_lists.html)
