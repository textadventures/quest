An objectlist is a [list](list.html) that can contain any number of elements, all of which have to be of type [object](object.html). see [Using Lists](../guides/using_lists.html) for more information.

The format in an ASLX file is:

     <mylist type="objectlist">player; object1; thing</mylist>

There is more on lists [here](using_lists.html).
