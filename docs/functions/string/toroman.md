    ToRoman (int)

**New in Quest 5.7**    

Returns a [string](../../types/string.html) - the given number in Roman numerals (i.e., I, II, III...). Good for numbers from 1 to 3999 (the Romans had no zero or negative numbers, this will produce an empty string; for high numbers, it will just add more and more Ms).
