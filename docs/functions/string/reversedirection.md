    ReverseDirection (string input)

**New in Quest 5.7**

Returns a [string](../../types/string.html), the reverse direction of the given string, so "northwest" becomes "southeast", and "in" becomes "out" (or the equivalent for the language you areusing). Only works for the full name (not "nw" for example). Unrecognised strings are returned unaltered.
