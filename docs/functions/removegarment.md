    RemoveGarment (object)

**New in Quest 5.7**    

The given object will stop being worn by the player. It will remain in the player's inventory. It will stop being flagged as "worn", and have its inventory verbs updated. This function is used by the REMOVE command, and should be used any other time the player will take off a garment.
