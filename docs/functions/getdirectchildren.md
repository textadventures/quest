    GetDirectChildren (object)

Returns an [objectlist](../types/objectlist.html) containing all objects directly contained by the parent object.

Use [GetAllChildObjects](getallchildobjects.html) instead to return all objects directly *or* indirectly contained (i.e. including children of children).

This function was moved from Core.aslx to become a Quest function as of Quest 5.1.

NOTE: This a [hard-coded function](hardcoded.html).
