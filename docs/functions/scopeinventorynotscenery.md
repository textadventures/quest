    ScopeInventoryNotScenery

**New in Quest 5.7**    

Returns an [object list](../types/objectlist.html), containing all the items held by the player, not flagged as scenery (note that when an object is picked up, the scenery flag is set to sale, so usually this will return the same list as `ScopeInventory`).
