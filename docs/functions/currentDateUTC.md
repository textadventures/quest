    CurrentDateUTC()

**New in Quest 5.9** 
Returns the [string](../types/string.html) value of the current Unix epoch time in UTC. 
When the game is started in the desktop player, the timestamp of the player's time zone is displayed. If the game is played via the browser over the Internet, the timestamp of the web server is output.

Information on the Unix timestamp can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)
