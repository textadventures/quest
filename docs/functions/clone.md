    Clone (object object to clone)

Clones the object and returns the created clone. It is generally better to use [CloneObject](corelibrary/cloneobject.html), which will automatically give the clone an alias so it will appear identical to the player (as names must be unique). 

See also [CloneObjectAndMove](corelibrary/cloneobjectandmove.html).

NOTE: This a [hard-coded function](hardcoded.html).
