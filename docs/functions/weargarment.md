    WearGarment (object)

**New in Quest 5.7**    

The given object will become worn by the player. It will be moved to the player's inventory, if not already there, be flagged as "worn", and have its inventory verbs updated. This function is used by the WEAR command, and should be used any other time the player will wear a garment (for example, to have an item worn at the start of the game).
