title: Asking a question
---

Often in a text adventure you want the game to ask an open-ended question of the player - the answer to a riddle, perhaps. The `get input` script command exists to handle just that. Here is an example script:
```
  msg ("'Hello. Can you answer my riddle? What walks on four legs in the morning, two in the afternoon, and three in the evening?'")
  get input {
    if (result = "man") {
      msg ("'Is it a man?' you ask.")
      msg ("'How come everyone knows the answer?'")
      msg ("'We have this thing called the internet nowadays...'")
    }
    else {
      msg ("'Is it \"" + result + "\"?' you ask.")
      msg ("'No!'")
    }
  }
```
The first line just asks the riddle. Then we see the `get input` command. The block after that gets run only once the player has typed a response. A magic variable called `result` has the text the player typed, so we just need to check it is the correct answer and react accordingly.

This will work, but has a couple of issues that we want to resolve.


Testing Input
-------------

The first problem is that the player has to type the exact string “man”. What if he types “Man” or “a man”? We might also like to handle “woman” and “human” so the riddle is more politically correct.

To do this, replace the third line with this:

```
  if (IsRegexMatch  ("man", LCase (result))) {
```

The LCase function will convert the player's text to all lower case, so “Man” will be handled as “man”. This text will then be matched against a Regex (a pattern) rather than a specific string. As long as the player has “man” somewhere in the answer, the pattern will match.

In this case, that will match human and woman too, which is great. Usually multiple answers are not so convenient, but you can do that too - just put them inside brackets and separate each with a vertical bar.

```
  if (IsRegexMatch  ("(man|lady)", LCase (result))) {
```

In fact, this will match anything with "man" in the word, so would also match "shaman". We could improve it by using `\b` to match against the word boundary, and then include all the options we will allow (note that you have to "escape" backslashes, so we use two here, `\\b`):

```
  if (IsRegexMatch  ("\\b(man|lady|woman|human|person)\\b", LCase (result))) {
```

We could optionally match "a" (the `?` indicates it is optional), and also match the start and end of the string with `^` and `$`:

```
  if (IsRegexMatch  ("^(a )?(man|lady|woman|human|person)$", LCase (result))) {
```

There is a section on Regex in the [pattern matching](pattern_matching.html) page.


Changing the Prompt
-------------------

This is worthwhile doing as it makes it clear to the player that he or she should not be typing a command. To get this to work, you need to use some JavaScript! 
```
  JS.eval("$('#txtCommand').attr('placeholder', 'Your answer');")
```
It might be worth also turning off the panes on the right, to stop the player messing with them when she should be answering the question:
```
  request (Hide, "Panes")
```
Remember to set them back to normal after.


Altogether Now...
-----------------

Here is the full the script, doing all we have discussed:
```
  msg ("'Hello. Can you answer my riddle? What walks on four legs in the morning, two in the afternoon, and three in the evening?'")
  JS.eval("$('#txtCommand').attr('placeholder', 'Your answer');")
  request (Hide, "Panes")
  get input {
    if (IsRegexMatch  ("^(a )?(man|lady|woman|human|person)$", LCase (result))) {
      msg ("'Is it a man?' you ask.")
      msg ("'How come everyone knows the answer?'")
      msg ("'We have this thing called the internet nowadays...'")
    }
    else {
      msg ("'Is it \"" + result + "\"?' you ask.")
      msg ("'No!'")
    }
    JS.eval("$('#txtCommand').attr('placeholder', 'Type here...');")
    request (Show, "Panes")
  }
```


Multiple questions
------------------

Occasionally you might want to ask several questions in a row. There is an issue here because of the way scripts run. Consider this code:
```
 msg("What is your name?")
 get input {
   player.name = result
 }
 msg("What is your age?")
 get input {
   player.age = result
 }
```
If you run that code, you will get this message:

> Error running script: Only one 'get input' can be in progress at a time

The problem is that `get input` does not pause the script. The first one fires, and then, even though the first is still waiting, the script continues immediately to the second `msg`, and then the second `get input`, which causes the error.

The solution is to _nest_ the second inside the first. You will probably then want to move the player to the start of the game inside the second one.
```
msg ("What is your name?")
get input {
  player.name = result
  msg ("What is your age?")
  get input {
    player.age = result
    MoveObject (player, room)
  }
}
```


Dozens of questions
-------------------

For a complex RPG-style game you might have lots of questions to create the character. There are ways to do that using JavaScript and dialogue panels, but they are not straightforward. However, you can use recursion. Which is also not straightforward, but is not _so_ bad.

The objective here is to ask a series of questions, which we will say is in a string list, game.questions, and put the answers in a second list, game.answers. Recursion is when a function calls itself; what will happen is the function will do `get input`, and then inside the `get input` we will call the function to ask the next question.

It is vitally important that a recursive function has a way of stopping, otherwise it will be trapped in an infinite loop. We will remove the question from the list after asking it, and will terminate when the list is empty.

Here is the code for the function, which is called `AskAQuestion` (no parameters or return type):
```
if (ListCount(game.questions) > 0) {
  s = StringListItem(game.questions, 0)
  list remove (game.questions, s)
  msg (s)
  get input {
    list add (game.answers, result)
    msg (">" + result)
    msg ("Thanks")
    AskAQuestion
  }
}
else {
  msg (" ")
  msg ("Name: " + StringListItem(game.answers, 0))
  msg ("Age: " + StringListItem(game.answers, 1))
  msg ("Favourite colour: " + StringListItem(game.answers, 2))
  msg (" ")
}
```
